# Reporting/Removing Content

If you are a copyright holder who would like to request content removal, my email is the fastest method of contact. I will try to respond to formal takedown requests as quickly as possible. Note that we do not host content, but simply link to them, and so you may need to issue take downs on the download links as well.
